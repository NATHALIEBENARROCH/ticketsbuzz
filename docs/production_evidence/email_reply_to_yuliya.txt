Subject: Please enable existing Production app (WCID 14733) for Ticketsbuzz

Hi Yuliya,

Thanks for the update. We had planned to keep a separate Production application for Ticketsbuzz for security and traceability, but if you intend to remove the older/unused Production app, we'd prefer to continue using the existing Production application (WCID 14733) to avoid disruption.

Please enable Production access for the client_id associated with WCID 14733. We will store the production client_id and secret in a secrets manager and rotate them as needed; we will not keep credentials in code or public repos.

Attached are redacted logs demonstrating successful production testing (token generation and GetEvents). Please confirm once the app is enabled, and let us know if you need the client_id value or any other details delivered via a secure channel.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
Ticketsbuzz
